To get the nth order PN expansion for Lagrangian by using xAct package(xTensor, xCoba, xPert) first and then directly using the taylor expansion method in Mathematica to get the PN expansion.

@ChristoffelSymbols(using xAct) is for 1PN christoffel till epsilon^4 
@RicciTensor(using xAct) is for 1PN Ricci Tensor till epsilon^4
>> Condensed Christoffel.nb is the notebook calculating the Christoffel in an efficient manner. And the Ricci Tensor up to an order of epsilon to power 5.
